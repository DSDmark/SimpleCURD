2. Find the downloaded zipped file on your pc and **extract it**.
3. Then install `nodejs` and `NPM` in your local system.
4. Open the Root Directory, navigate to SimpleCURD using the command `cd SimpleCURD` and use either `npm install` or `pnpm install` to install all dependencies in the frontend and backend directories.

3. Then install `Docker` in your local system.
